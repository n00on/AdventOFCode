# Advent Of Code Solutions

This repo contains many of my AOC solutions.

## 2023 in Elixir

I am currently learning Elixir and want to dive deeper into it and functional programming.  
Also I think it may be suitable for many AOC tasks.  
We'll see..

## 2022 in Python3

The year I opened this repo.  
I used python for scripting solutions easily and rapidly and to get more familiar in this language.  
Most of my finished solutions are here.  
I want to go back at some point and get my last stars.

## 2021 in Java

The first year I participated.  
I used Java as it was the language I was most familiar at the time.  
Currently no code of this year is in this repo.  
I may risk a look back on my old code and put some of it up, but we'll see if I'll live through it.

## Prior years

I also did some puzzles of earlier years, mainly in Python3 and Elixir.  
I may upload some of it or do a year in TS/JS or something.
